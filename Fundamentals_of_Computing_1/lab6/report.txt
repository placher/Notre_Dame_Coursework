From the user's perspective, the program manipulates a database of movie quotes that is pulled from a startup text file. After
reading the startup database from the file, the program gives the user the option to add to the database, view current members
of the database, search the database for a substring, or print the database to a new text file. The program will continue to
offer these options until the user chooses to exit the program from the main menu.

From a programming perspective, the program relies on a 2-dimensional global array to serve as the sayings database. A while
loop keeps the program running, and a series of sub-functions handle operations. The database is initialized by using fgets()
to read from a filename/path passed by the user using stdin. Two of the operation files, newstring() and sayingsearch() use
similar methods to take strings from the user and either append them to the database or querry the database with the string
acting as a search parameter. savetotext() also uses this method to create a new text file containing the current database:
using fopen() to create a new text file in "write" mode to recieve from the instances of fprintf(). The utilization of all of 
these functions is controlled by program(), which was written to serve as an independent control object.

Since the program's purpose is to manipulate strings, accuracy can be evaluated by ordering the operation of a function on the
database and then using the printallsayings() function to inspect the database and evaluate the correctness of the changes
ordered/made. The sayingsearch() function could also be corroborated by a manual search through the database. Finally,
savetotext() could be evaluated by exiting the program and opening mysayings.txt and checking the file for accuracy. All of
these tests showed that the program runs exactly as intended.
