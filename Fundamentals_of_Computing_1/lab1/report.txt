The purpose of prog3.c was to compute the real roots of a quadratic equation of the formula ax^2 + bx + c. The program begins
by initializing float variables for a, b, and c at a value of 1.0 and then prompting the user for values for these three
variables. An if check in line 12 prevents the value of a from being set to 0, and that would result in an eventual divide by
zero. After taking input values from the user, the program implements the quadratic formula and stores the values in two new
float variables, x1 and x2. These values, and the user's original equation, are printed to the screen before the program ends.
To test the program for accuracy, a number of known samples and results were entered, ensuring that accurate results were
generated. There are no known cases where incorrect results are produced.
