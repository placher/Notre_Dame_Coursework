From the user's perspective, ndfootball.c provides a number of analyses on the win/loss records of the Notre Dame football team.
Users can choose from a list of six possible statistical analyses, entering the number of their choice, followed by any additional
information necessary. The results are then printed to the screen, either in an array or as a statement.

From the programmer's perspective, the program evaluates the user's input with a case structure, running a sub-program to perform
the necessary calculations. In multiple cases, for loops are used to search over the arrays of wins and losses for specific
criteria, from number of games played, to years with specific win/loss records. The results are printed as they are found instead
of retaining them to save memory.

To evaluate the program for correctness, the results can be verified by hand for all of the analyses performed. In all cases, the
program produced accurate results.
