In lab 7, we were asked to create a program that uses multiple shapes and colors, as well as cicrular motion, all animated in a
X11 window. From the user perspective, the program opens an instance of X11 and draws a ferris wheel composed of a circle and
square "cars" as well as spokes radiaiting out from the center. At the begining of the program, the wheel is slowly rotating
clockwise. The user can change the speed and direction of motion by pressing the "+" and "-" keys.

From a programming perspective, the image is animated in an infinite loop. Each iteration (0.1 sec), the image is cleared and
redrawn in its new position. The position of the main circle is never changed, and the positions of the "cars" are determined
using polar coordinates. To keep the cars upright, they are redrawn at every iteration relative to the calculated point, meaning
that they will always be drawn level relative to the sides of the window. The spokes are drawn radially from the center of the
circle to the center of the boxes. When the user presses a key (+ or -) a multiplier for the angle of rotation is incremented
by one, resulting in faster/slower rotation, or even rotation in the opposite direction.

Since the program is only an animation, evaluating it for correctness simply means ensuring that it renders as designed, which
can be confirmed visually.
