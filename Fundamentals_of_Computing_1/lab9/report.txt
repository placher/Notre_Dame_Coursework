From the user's perspective, the program opens an instance of X11 and waits for a user input. When the user presses a number
(1-8) the screen is cleared of any previous output and a fractal is drawn, continuing the program until 'q' is pressed.

From the programming perspective, the project is somewhat more complicated. The program opens an instance of X11 and enters a
while loop. If gfx_event_waiting() returns true, then the program reads the new input from the user. The X11 window is cleared and
the input is passed through a case structure. If the input was 'q', then the 'continue' variable is set to 0 and the program ends.
Otherwise, the program calls the function for the corresponding fractal. Each fractal is drawn by a recursive function that
calls itself at least once every iteration to build the completed image out of corresponding smaller images, and ending when
a specific base case has been met.

To evaluate the program for correctness, the compiled fractals were compared to the provided examples of each fractal. By looking
at the finished images, and by testing random commands to the program, I was able to ensure that the program runs smoothly and 
correctly.
