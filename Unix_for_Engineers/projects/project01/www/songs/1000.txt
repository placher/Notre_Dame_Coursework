1000 Times A Day
================

A thousand times a day I tell you I love the way you sing
Even though it makes me cry, it's my favorite time to be alive
And all I know is I feel lost without you
“I miss you” is not enough

I know the story's old; it's been told a million times before
But to tell it feels so good
It reminds me that not all I do is right
And all I know is I feel so lost without you

Now I remember the day I was a kid in 8th grade
Your friend tapped me on my shoulder and asked if I would be your boyfriend 
Oh, yeah, we were intense then
We would walk and hold hands 
You were taller than me then I got a friend to tell you that 
I didn't wanna be anymore
Oh, no, not anymore

So then for 3 more years we would never talk 
And I'm not gonna lie though, I couldn't stop thinking about you
Then your best friends came over and I got them to call you
To see if you wanted to watch the band play “Dude Ranch”
I knew that that would impress you
So then we got to talking and before we knew it we were always on the phone
Talking until 4 in the morning
Yeah, there was only one problem
Now, I never knew your man, never talked to him 
And still to this day I feel bad for it, but I knew that I loved you 
And I knew that I had to do something

So I waited till the day that you broke up with him 
We had a barbeque at our friend Jim's
Then we strolled to the backyard and that's where we shared our first kiss 
Then you watched the band play with all your friends 
And we played our set of Millencolin and Choking Victim
I guess that didn't impress you
‘Cause then an hour later between you and your friends 
You told me that you didn't want to be anymore
Oh, no, not anymore

But then a while later we got back together 
And we told each other we would be forever 
And since that day we had our share of problems 
And now we know that it's hard but better together
Oh, yeah, it's better together

So now we have a house and a couple pets
We're even getting married 9 years after it
And every time I see you
I still hear trumpets
