Burn This City
==============

Stay up all night and sleep all day,
We were smart kids with too much to say,
and so, so sure that they were missing out.
They're the ones who are missing out
We were elemental, talked down to bare essentials.
Who knew we'd get so far?

Cause our days were numbered by nights on too many rooftops.
They said we'd burn so bright.
We burn this city and go.

Play it again, (our games of love and lust.)
There's no such thing (no there's never too much).
And we were so, so sure, no we never had a doubt.
We're counting down the days to getting out and
We were elemental, talked down to bare essentials.
Who knew we'd get so far?

Cause our days were numbered by nights on too many rooftops.
They said we're wasting our lives,
Oh at least we know, that if we die - we lived with passion.
They said we'd burn so bright.
We burn this city and go.

Pack our bags and get away - they're catching on to us.
So pack our bags and get away - they're catching on to us.
Pack our bags and get away - they're catching on to us.
Pack our bags and get away - they're catching on to us.

Cause our days were numbered by nights on too many rooftops.
They said we're wasting our lives,
Oh at least we know, that if we die - we lived with passion.
They said we'd burn so bright.
We burn this city, and go.
